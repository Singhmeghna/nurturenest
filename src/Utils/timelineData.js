    motherSymptoms:
      "Here are some of the 6-week pregnancy symptoms you may notice: • Swollen breasts: This is a sign that you are getting ready for lactation. Keep your padded bras in the back of your drawer and bring out those comfy sports bras out. • Frequent urination: This can be a bit irritating in the beginning! But here's a great tip: leaning forward while urinating helps in clearing out the bladder more. Once done, pace around your room for about 30 seconds, the rest of the urine will also come out. This will make your trips to the washroom less frequent. Tiredness: Drink at least eight glasses of water every day and focus on foods rich in fiber. It is going to make you feel much better and a lot less tired. Mood swings: The high level of pregnancy hormones can be blamed for the annoying mood swings. Be conscious and wary of these signs, and try to be calm. Nausea and vomiting : This is the healthiest sign of pregnancy in the initial weeks.

    scan: "At 7-week pregnancy, you can see the baby-to-be is developing in a bubble within the gestational sac. • The bubble you see around the embryo is the amniotic cavity, filled with amniotic fluid. • This liquid environment gives your baby room to grow and move. The amniotic fluid also protects your baby-to-be from any external pressure on the abdomen. • The black area you notice inside the head is part of the developing neural tube.",
    babySummary:
      "Did you know that your little one is approximately a quarter of an inch in length at 7-week pregnancy? Amazing, right? • The size of your baby's head may seem abnormally large in proportion to the rest of the body right now. But that is nothing to be worried about. That is just how a baby develops. Your baby is now developing something that resembles a tail. Don't be alarmed as this is just a part of the baby's tailbone, which will slowly disappear in the coming weeks. You will be amazed to know that your baby now has a fold that resembles eyelids and an adorably tiny tip of the nose too! • Not to forget, your baby now has a mouth and a tongue as well. The little one's teeth and palate are forming in full swing and his ears are developing too. The umbilical cord is working in full gear as it has its own set of blood vessels which carry nutrients and oxygen to the baby. There's more... While your baby has already developed a pancreas and an appendix, the liver is moving blood about until a bone marrow comes around to take over. • Your baby's brain is steadily growing too.",
    motherSymptoms:
      "Heartburn Swelling and spots on breasts: Are you noticing a striking change on your breasts? They have been steadily growing in size, yes, and will continue to. You will see that your areola is now darker in color and has developed some spots on it too. These spots keep the nipples lubricated and supple. They are going to disappear with time, of course. Heartburn: The hormones are having a party inside your body, as a result the muscles on top of your stomach tend to relax a bit. This causes the digestive acids and fluids to just rise back up. Result? That burning sensation in your heart. Stick to a light diet and have lots of water. Antacids can be an option too, but after consulting the doctor. Drooling: Do you wake up every morning with a drool all over your face? Don't worry about this too much as it generally stops with the first trimester. For the day time, you may want to keep a few tissues handy. Cravings & aversions: Are you hating the sight of your favorite food now? Do you feel like eating a specific dish, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? Don't worry. Cravings and aversions to food and smell are quite common in pregnancy.",

Relax, such ups and downs are quite normal in the initial weeks of pregnancy, thanks to nausea and morning sickness. Even if you are not able to eat really well, you must not forget to have all the essential vitamin supplements prescribed to you by the doctor, folic acid being the most important of them all. • Try and include a good variety of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, and other non-vegetarian food items in your daily diet.

    babySummary:
      "If last week saw those hands sprout webbed-looking fingers, this week gives way to proper individual fingers. You can also see extremely small toes too. Slowly and steadily your baby is taking fundamental strides and has now developed elbows which help him/her move their arms about. Your baby's heartbeat is around 160 per minute but here is the fabulous news, it is now divided into four chambers. The valves which help the blood go in and out are starting to form. The umbilical cord also has a full-time job now. The umbilical cord is made up of one vein and two arteries, which are connected to the baby's abdomen. The job of the vein is to carry blood to the baby's heart while the arteries are at work carrying the blood from the heart to the placenta. Another big news, your baby's genitals have now started to form. The size of your baby is now only a little shy of an inch. Hair follicles have now appeared and so have nipples. Your baby's eyelids are still shut and will continue to be so for a while, nonetheless those little ears are now more pronounced and protruding. • However, the weight of the baby doesn't differ too much in comparison to the previous week.",

      "At 10 week pregnancy, your baby's organs and tissues are cultivating quite swiftly. Your little one is now a little bigger than an inch and since he/she is still so small, they can freely move about in your protective amniotic fluid. Although their eyes are still shut, their face is starting to look a lot more human-like than the week before. While last week saw your baby grow a tiny little tongue, this week gives way for his permanent tooth buds. This leads us to mentioning that your baby now has a proper jawbone too. Your baby's head is now more proportionate to the rest of his body and their wrists and ankles have taken shape too. Their arms have grown so much and he/ she can bend their arms at the wrist. The fingernails rowed u his very thin hair on the skin. • The liver, kidneys, intestines, brain, and lungs are fully formed and functional now. The basic divisions of the brain are now clearly marked out and at one end of the spinal cord, neurons appear.

Your baby's eyes, which were a little far apart from each other in the previous weeks have now significantly moved closer together and the baby can also clench his eye muscles. The ears have finally settled exactly where they should be. While synapses are rapidly forming in your baby's brain, nerves cells are also multiplying as though they were in a competition to win. Your little one can also pee now as the kidneys have begun to excrete urine into the bladder. The bone marrow is now making tons and tons of white blood cells.

Do we need to remind you to drink plenty of water, we hope not! Heartburn or indigestion : Are you eating too many snacks? Or are you not exercising enough? Try to go easy on spicy and oily food and drink plenty of water. Exercise regularly without fail.",
    bodyHealth:
      "You may also have noticed another change about this time. Your breasts are probably starting to leak. Let's jog our memory back to a few weeks before wherein we spoke about colostrum. Colostrum is the thick, milk-like substance your breasts produce before they can start making milk. • As your pregnancy progresses, so does the amount of colostrum. Hence, it is only natural that it leaks time and again. • You may want to stock up on some breast pads now. • However, don't worry if you don't see any leakage all through your pregnancy. That is also a normal scenario for many women.",

    scan: "With the baby crouched and the legs pulled in toward the chest, you can almost see his/her complete profile. Now that the baby is more than 8 inches in length, it's hard to capture the image of baby's entire body... Your baby is about to experience a dramatic weight gain in the coming weeks. For now, he/she is still relatively thin.",
    babySummary:
      "Your little one is already about 11 inches and a half. Every new week your baby looks more and more like an actual infant. Your baby now weighs about 450 grams as he/she is accumulating fat all over. Your baby is not the only one who has put on weight though. You too have probably put on about eight kilograms by now. We are confident that by now you have been feeling your little one move and wriggle around inside your body. We are also assuming that you have figured out your baby's sleeping pattern by now. Studies have shown that most babies continue to follow the patterns they observe inside the womb even after they are born. Although their skin is still very translucent and saggy, it will soon start getting thicker. Your baby's skin which appears reddish at this point in time is growing faster than the fat. • Your baby is also learning to practice breathing this week onwards as blood vessels in his/her little lungs continue to develop, and the nostrils have two distinct holes on them. Your baby's bone marrow now assumes the responsibility of making blood cells. Up until this point, this task was carried out by the liver and spleen. Your little one's heart, which has been quite famous for beating twice as fast as yours, is growing stronger every day. This ensures that blood is being pumped and circulated throughout his/her entire body.",
    motherSymptoms:
      "Skin discoloration: Either you are having that radiant pregnancy glow or you might suddenly notice that your face has dark patches! Your skin will be quite sensitive and will react to even minor changes in your surroundings. You may notice small growths and thicker moles on your skin, and certain areas like arms and inner thighs may become darker than the usual color. Your breasts may have become darker too if you notice. Apart from hormonal changes, your diet is also a deciding factor for these symptoms. Most of these marks will disappear after delivery. • Bleeding gums: Go easy on sugar, mainly chewing gums and sweets. Do remember to brush twice a day and maintain good dental hygiene. Tingling hands: This is mainly due to the swelling during pregnancy. Do learn to relax your hands if you're at work for too long. Keep changing positions and see if you will like some stressbuster toys for your palms. Bloating : Do you know that pregnancy hormones have an impact on your whole body's functions? The increased production of pregnancy hormones causes the gastrointestinal tract to relax and this slows down digestion. Though this allows the nutrients enough time to get to the baby, you may start feeling bloated because of this. Water intake is key here. Healthy appetite : Do you feel like you can empty your whole fridge just in one meal? Of course, you may be feeling so. Remember to eat right and exercise regularly. Avoid junk food as much as you can.",

    scan: "• The ultrasound scan on the left shows a magnified view of the four chambers of the baby's heart. In the scan on the right, you can notice the blood flowing from the upper chambers of the baby's heart (the atria) into the lower chambers (the ventricles). The walls of the ventricles are more muscular than the atria because they have to pump blood to the baby's lungs and the rest of the body.",
    babySummary:
      "By week 23, your baby has developed all the organs needed to survive outside your womb in case they were born prematurely. Your baby's blood vessels in the lungs are also developing swiftly in preparation for breathing outside the uterus. This week your baby's skin looks thin and translucent. Your baby might also look fairly red because of the visible blood vessels, but don't worry, the final skin color is yet to develop. • Your baby's hearing senses are also strengthening this week as their bones harden. He/she can also hear loud external sounds like sirens, horns, and music. In case you have been talking to your baby regularly, you may notice how they are responding to specific sounds.",
    motherSymptoms:
      "Nail and hair growth: You may notice that your nails are growing more than normal, and they are probably softer too. Your hair may be thicker and luscious than usual as well. You may or may not necessarily have noticed these changes, but they do happen. The reason remains the same - high production of pregnancy hormones inside your system. You may also notice hair growth on parts where you have never had them! This goes away within a few months after giving birth though. • Leg cramps: Another common symptom - leg cramps tend to become worse with every passing week. Try to straighten your legs and slowly flex your ankles and toes up toward your shins multiple times. This may give you some relief. Swollen feet & ankles: Most pregnant women suffer from swollen feet and ankles. Try to take frequent breaks from your chores and put your feet up whenever you can. • Lower abdominal pain: As your uterus continues to grow, the ligaments that support it stretch, and this leads to some amount of pain in the lower abdomen. If you see bleeding along with severe cramps, do alert your doctor. Migraines: Are you suffering from severe headaches that last for days? Do you see blurred images? Too nauseous as well? Do keep track of these symptoms and let your doctor know. Migraines are a common symptom and can be tackled well.",
